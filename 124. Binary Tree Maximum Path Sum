Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

class Solution {
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        return findmaxsum(root, maxSum);;
    }
    
    public in findmaxsum()
}
